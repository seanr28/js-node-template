# Reflection for Loops

```
     The most challenging thing for me while learning loops was getting the i statement right.
    I would have all of the right information assigned but would having something wrong in the
    i statement. After messing around with loops, and the console log info and the i statements
    I got it down and was able to understand it enough to work with it. For example, after
    writing the let i statement, you would have to write a “const game = games[i]” like in
    the game list example. I didn’t fully understand what that was doing for the program
    until I realized after seeing some of JS Code fill in that game allows for all the
    different game titles to be different arrays and the i is there, so it doesn’t repeat
    a title.
	    Reading the text alone is hard for me to understand what I’m doing in the 1st place. So I
    could kind of see where it was going, but the video allows me to see you type the code and
    see the result which allows me to see what the code does in action.  With you talking over
    explain what each part does in the code as well is extremely beneficial and information
    that I can’t receive fully by just reading.
	Loops can be useful for many reasons one comes to mind, using a while loop to see of something
    true like refreshing a page once someone has scrolled to far, it will see something is false
    or true in the page and will loop a refresh until that statement is false or true again.
    A 'while' loop checks to see if something is true or false before continuing, while a ‘for’
    loop is pre-set to stop after a certain amount of times that you decide.
